## Welcome :")

What do I need to run this program? Linux

If you are on Debian or Ubuntu or Arch (including their variants ) 
You __don't need to preinstall anything__, script will handle requirements when ran from
CLI for first time. You will be prompted to input password to install them.

If you want to run script by double clicking it , Install _zenity_ and _notify-send_ on your 
distribution , it's totally optional since CLI works too.

Are you on other Distributions? Get these beforehand !!!
1. gifsicle (May be removed soon )
2. imagemagick 
3. apngasm < 3.x supported
4. python-pip (could be uninstalled after initial setup )
5. cmake ( could be uninstalled after initial setup )
6. (totally optional) zenity (for GUI)

What would initial setup install ? 
1. [tgs-to-gif](https://github.com/ed-asriyan/tgs-to-gif/tree/master-cpp) (May be removed soon)
2. python-telegram-bot
3. signalstickers-client

V2 Intial setup 
1. Get Telegram Bot token ready
2. Now open Signal Desktop 
    - Goto Menu 
		- Toggle Developers tools 
		- On there open Console 
		- Store somehwere output of window.reduxStore.getState().items.uuid_id 
		- Also store outut of window.reduxStore.getState().items.password

#### Don't share both of these with anyone else

#### V2 of the script  handles uploading by it's own !!!!
What does v2 of this script does?

Asks you for stickerpack link of Telegram
Gives you stickerpack link of Signal :")

---

#### What if My stickerpack failed to upload? (Network issues etc)
Don't you worry, got you there. Just run the command again and it would
ask to upload packs not uploaded before due to network issues etc.

You can choose to restore/upload backups created or convert a new stickerpack to signal 

Can be done using both CLI and GUI 

Once those are uploaded they would be deleted from hard drive.

#### How to see what all packs i converted with this script ?

```
cat packs

```

#### Background 

For v2 you need just the link to stickerpack, __NO NEED TO DOWNLOAD TGS FILES__
Just have links like "https://t.me/addstickers/HalloUtya" and that's enough !!!!

For bot to upload on your behalf, using your account credentials given above.

If you want telegram bot token get it using [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) :")

Once Intial setup , from next time just sending link would be enough.
